# Crystal ANSI

This library helps send escape sequences to Unix terminals. Now you don't need to use bloated dependencies like termbox or curses to position text in the terminal.

## Installation

Include the ANSI module in your code:

```require "colorize"
include ANSI```

## Usage

Most of the escape sequences are pretty self explanatory by name. There's a wonderful guide [here](http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html) if you want more details.
